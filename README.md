Simple php site connected to database that allows to researsh and edit database by web GUI instead of typing whole SQL code to join or delete data from database, it will be better soon.
I will add buttons for choosing table from database to edit and i will try to add auto input into fields that connected to another table by foreign key and maybe add some security 
instruments to avoid SQL injectios in future. And i will work on users permisions and rights to avoid unsactcioned views or editing/destroying of data whats needed to avoid.
You need to install OS Panel or another local hosting instrument to launch this code.

Sorry Discord for stealing yours desingn, for sure i like it/





If i dont edit this repository i've been kicked from University :(


First step completed , i've added button to switch between tables of database to browse
